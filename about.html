              <h3>Our Origins</h3>
              <p>
                The Nagelia family was a result of one of
                <span class="highlight">Maharaj Agrasen's</span> progeny named
                <span class="highlight">Mittal</span>, thus, we got our gotra as
                Mittal. Our ancestors initially settled in a small village known
                as <span class="highlight">Nangolia</span>, situated 70km away
                from another village <span class="highlight">Kalukabas</span> of
                Jaipur District.
              </p>
              <p>
                Due to an outbreak of a disease in Nangolia, our ancestors
                migrated to Kalukabas. Thus, our ancestors were called
                "Nangolia" by the residents of Kalukabas. Later on, Nangolia was
                pronounced as Nagelia.
              </p>

                Here we would also like to mention that we Nagelia's can put any
                of the three surnames i.e. "Agarwal" as a progeny of Maharaj
                Agrasen, "Mittal" significance of our gotra, and "Nagelia" as
                our origin village. We worship
                <span class="highlight">Kalka Mata</span> as our
                <span class="highlight">Kul Devi</span>.

              <p>
                There is a big temple of Kalka Mata few kilometers away from the
                village Kalukabas. The temple is situated on the top of a
                mountain and only way to reach there is by foot climbing more
                than 500 steps. This is where we perform Jarula Ceremony
                (Mundan) of our children.

              <h3>About our Ancestors</h3>
              <p>
                Our great great grandfather <b>Late Ramchandra ji</b> was born
                in the village Kalukabas. Ramchandra ji was blessed with three
                sons. The eldest son was <b>Late Bakshiram ji</b>, second in the
                line was <b>Late Badriprasad ji</b> and the youngest son was
                <b>Late Shivprasad ji</b>. They were our great grandfather.
              </p>
              <p>
                We form the generation after our great grandfathers. Eldest son
                Bakshiram ji was blessed with four sons called
                <b>Jainarayan ji, Mungilal ji, Sualal ji and Balabaksh ji</b>.
                Jainarayan ji’s only son was <b>Madanlal ji</b>. Madanlal ji has
                spent his entire life in kalukabas with his family. Badriprasad
                ji had no children of his own so, he adopted <b>Nandlal ji</b>,
                the eldest son of <b>Shivprasad ji</b>. Nandlal ji’s son was
                <b>Lakshminarayan ji</b>. Youngest Shivprasad ji was blessed
                with four sons namely Nandlal ji(adopted by Badriprasad ji),
                <b>Shivnarayan ji, Bansidhar ji</b> and <b>Nathulal ji</b>.
                Shivnarayan ji, son of Shivprasad ji was the first person of
                Nagelia family who migrated to Jamshedpur for better prospects
                in business in the year 1928. He dreamt for a happy and
                prosperous Negelia family so, he called all his brothers and
                parents to Jamshedpur. All his brothers and parents came to
                Jamshedpur. Now his dreams have come true.
